After HTML creation & linking/scripting all sources.

ON HTML:

1 - create 5 input forms (give each a id (since all are for different areas) - (can give a class depending on how it will be used)

2 - create a Submit button (Give ID Name)

3 - create a table base on HTML for the input of the forms etc.

3.a - create basic css for the tables etc.
3.b - Check layout on the html

ON JS

4 - Create a function that gets the inputs from the various input boxes.

5 - create a function that when on the click of the button it grabs the data from the inputs.

6 - append that data that was grabbed into a the table body (<tr><td>)

7 - calculate monthly costs (all salaries together - place into the table footer cell)


**HARD MODE**
Create a delete button that removes an employee from the DOM. For Hard mode, it does not need to remove that Employee's salary from the reported total.

Add styling to the page.

**PRO MODE**
Once the employee is deleted, update the total spend on salaries account for this employee's removal.
This will require that the logic knows which element was removed. Look into jQuery's
.data() function. You will need to do something both when the employee is added and when they are deleted.
